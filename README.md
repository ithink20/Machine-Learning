#### Supervised Learning
In Supervised Learning, we are given a dataset and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is relationship between input and output.

Supervised learning problems are chategorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict the results within the continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. **Ex: House Price Predicition**.

In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.**Ex: Breast Cancer**

**Example 1:**

Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.

We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house "sells for more or less than the asking price." Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.

**Example 2:**

(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
